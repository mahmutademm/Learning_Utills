        {"term": "Stock", "definition": "A security that represents ownership in a fraction of a corporation. Entitles the owner to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits. Stocks can be common or preferred, with common stocks offering voting rights and potential dividends, while preferred stocks provide fixed dividends but limited voting rights. Stock prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, company performance, and market conditions. They are key components of investment portfolios and can be traded on exchanges.", "example": "Buying one share of Apple (AAPL) makes you a part-owner of Apple Inc. If Apple performs well, the stock price may rise, and you might receive dividends. However, if the company struggles, the stock value could decline. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, many stocks lost significant value, but long-term holders of strong companies like Apple saw substantial recovery and growth.", "chart": "AAPL", "concept": "price", "quiz": [
            {"q": "A stock represents which of the following?", "options": [
                {"text": "A loan to a company", "reasoning": "This is a common misconception. A loan to a company is a form of debt, and the holder is a lender, not an owner. This type of investment is typically a bond, which pays interest. Stocks, on the other hand, represent ownership."},
                {"text": "Ownership in a company", "reasoning": "Correct! A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation, making you a part-owner with a claim on its assets and profits."}
            ], "correct": 1}
        ]},
        {"term": "Ticker Symbol", "definition": "A unique series of letters assigned to a security for trading purposes. E.g., 'AAPL' for Apple, 'TSLA' for Tesla.", "example": "To buy or analyze a stock, you almost always start with its ticker symbol. For example, 'AAPL' is Apple on NASDAQ.", "chart": None, "quiz": [
            {"q": "What is the primary purpose of a ticker symbol?", "options": [
                {"text": "To hide a company's real name", "reasoning": "While it's an abbreviation, the purpose isn't to hide the name but to make it faster and easier to identify for trading."},
                {"text": "To uniquely identify a stock for trading", "reasoning": "Correct! Ticker symbols are abbreviations that allow for fast and unambiguous identification of securities on exchanges."}

    "üìà Basic Charting": [
        {"term": "Support", "definition": "A price level where a falling stock tends to stop and may reverse upward, caused by a concentration of demand.", "example": "In 2022, the S&P 500 found strong support around the $360 level, bouncing off it multiple times.", "chart": "SPY", "concept": "support", "quiz": [
            {"q": "Support is a price level that acts as a...", "options": [
                {"text": "Floor", "reasoning": "Correct! Support acts as a floor where buying pressure is strong enough to stop a price from falling further."},
                {"text": "Ceiling", "reasoning": "A price ceiling is known as 'resistance,' which is the opposite of support."}

        ]},
        {"term": "Resistance", "definition": "A price level where a rising stock tends to stop and may reverse downward, caused by a concentration of supply.", "example": "Tesla faced major resistance at the $300 mark throughout 2023 before its breakout.", "chart": "TSLA", "concept": "resistance", "quiz": [
            {"q": "Resistance is a price level that acts as a...", "options": [

    "üõí Essential Order Types": [
        {"term": "Market Order", "definition": "An order to buy or sell a stock immediately at the best available current price. It guarantees execution but not the price.", "example": "Use a market order when you want to get in or out of a stock quickly and are less concerned about the exact price.", "chart": None, "quiz": [
            {"q": "A market order guarantees...", "options": [
                {"text": "The price you want", "reasoning": "This describes a 'limit order.' A market order prioritizes speed over price."},

        ]},
        {"term": "Limit Order", "definition": "An order to buy or sell a stock at a specific price or better. Provides price control but may not execute.", "example": "If AAPL is at $175, you can set a buy limit order at $170 to purchase it only if the price drops.", "chart": None, "quiz": [
            {"q": "A limit order guarantees...", "options": [
                {"text": "The price you want (or better)", "reasoning": "Correct! A limit order prioritizes price over execution."},
