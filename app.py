Stocks can be common or preferred, with common stocks offering voting rights and potential dividends, while preferred stocks provide fixed dividends but limited voting rights. Stock prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, company performance, and market conditions. They are key components of investment portfolios and can be traded on exchanges.", "example": "Buying one share of Apple (AAPL) makes you a part-owner of Apple Inc. If Apple performs well, the stock price may rise, and you might receive dividends. However, if the company struggles, the stock value could decline. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, many stocks lost significant value, but long-term holders of strong companies like Apple saw substantial recovery and growth.", "chart": "AAPL", "concept": "price", "quiz": [
            {"q": "A stock represents which of the following?", "options": [
                {"text": "A loan to a company", "reasoning": "This is a common misconception. A loan to a company is a form of debt, and the holder is a lender, not an owner. This type of investment is typically a bond, which pays interest. Stocks, on the other hand, represent ownership."},
                {"text": "Ownership in a company", "reasoning": "Correct! A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation, making you a part-owner with a claim on its assets and profits."}

            {"q": "If you own a stock, you are entitled to...", "options": [
                {"text": "A fixed interest payment", "reasoning": "This describes a bond or other debt instrument. Stockholders are owners, not lenders, so they don't receive fixed interest. Their returns come from stock price appreciation and potential dividends, which are not guaranteed."},
                {"text": "A piece of the company's debt", "reasoning": "This is the opposite of what a stock represents. As a stockholder, you own a piece of the company's equity (ownership). The company's debt is owed to its lenders, such as bondholders."},
                {"text": "A portion of the company's assets and profits", "reasoning": "Exactly! As a part-owner, you have a claim on the company's assets and any profits it distributes (as dividends). Your share's value grows as the company becomes more valuable."},
                {"text": "The right to manage the company's daily operations", "reasoning": "While stockholders are owners, they don't run the company day-to-day. They elect a board of directors, who in turn hire executives (like the CEO) to manage operations. Your power is in voting, not managing."}

                {"text": "It gives you a claim on assets", "reasoning": "This statement is actually true. As an owner, you have a claim on the company's assets, although debt holders get paid first in a bankruptcy."},
                {"text": "It means the company owes you a specific amount of money back", "reasoning": "Correct! This is the statement that is NOT true. A stock's value fluctuates and is not a guaranteed loan. The company does not owe you your initial investment back; you must sell the stock on the market to another investor to get your money out."},
                {"text": "It represents equity", "reasoning": "This statement is true. 'Stock' and 'equity' are often used interchangeably to mean ownership in a company."},
                {"text": "You can profit if the company does well", "reasoning": "This statement is true. If the company's profits and value grow, the stock price is likely to increase, leading to a profit for you when you sell."},

            {"q": "In a bankruptcy, who gets paid before common stockholders?", "options": [

                {"text": "Bondholders and creditors", "reasoning": "Correct! In liquidation, debt holders (bondholders and creditors) are paid first, followed by preferred stockholders, and common stockholders last."},
                {"text": "Employees", "reasoning": "Employees are often paid as operational expenses, but in bankruptcy, secured creditors come first."},
                {"text": "Government taxes", "reasoning": "Taxes are a form of debt and are paid before stockholders."},
                {"text": "Suppliers", "reasoning": "Suppliers are unsecured creditors and get paid before stockholders but after secured creditors."},
                {"text": "No one; stockholders are first", "reasoning": "This is incorrect; stockholders are last in line."},
                {"text": "The CEO and executives", "reasoning": "Executives may have claims as employees or through contracts, but they are not prioritized over creditors."}

            {"q": "Which type of stock typically offers voting rights but no fixed dividends?", "options": [

                {"text": "Common stock", "reasoning": "Correct! Common stock provides voting rights and potential dividends based on company performance, but they are not fixed."},
                {"text": "Treasury stock", "reasoning": "Treasury stock is repurchased by the company and has no rights."},
                {"text": "Convertible stock", "reasoning": "Convertible stock can be converted to common stock, but it's a type of preferred."},

                {"text": "Bonds", "reasoning": "Bonds are debt, not stock."},

Ticker symbols are used to identify stocks, ETFs, and other securities on exchanges, facilitating quick trading and data retrieval. They can vary by exchange and may include suffixes for different share classes or types.", "example": "To buy or analyze a stock, you almost always start with its ticker symbol. For example, 'AAPL' is Apple on NASDAQ, while 'BRK.A' and 'BRK.B' represent different classes of Berkshire Hathaway shares on NYSE. Tickers help in avoiding confusion between similar company names.", "chart": None, "quiz": [
